    "3. Since these probabilities are all numbers less than 1, multiplying a lot of numbers less than 1 will result in a tiny, tiny, tiny number, which can result in numerical underflow. So in practice, instead of maximizing this product, we will take logs and log of a product becomes sum of a log which is the 2nd formula. This provides us with a numerically stable algorithm that is less prone to rounding errors. Because the log function is strictly monotonically increasing function, we know that maximizing log P(y) given x should give the same result as maximizing P(y) given x.\n",
    "4. This objective function has an undesirable effect where it unnaturally tends to prefer very short translations(because the value of multiplying small number of probabilities is higher). The same is true for the log of probability (since the log of values less than 1 is in negative range). To solve this, we normalize the result by dividing it by number of tokens."
